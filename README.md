# Currency_Converter_Compose

My first app developed with Jetpack Compose. It fetches currency rates from my [Spring Boot server](https://github.com/maciekpawlowski1/currency_converter_spring) created before

## Architecture pattern

## Language

## Dependency Injection
Hilt
## Other technology used

## Security
Just for simplicity app uses Api Key to authenticate with the server. If used in production, should use more secure approach
